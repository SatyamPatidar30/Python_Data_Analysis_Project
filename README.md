# Hotel Booking Analysis Project

## About the data
This dataset contains 119390 observations for a City Hotel and a Resort Hotel. Each observation represents a hotel booking between the 1st of July 2015 and 31st of August 2017, including booking that effectively arrived and booking that were canceled.
## Business Problem
In the year 2015 to 2017, City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is dealing with a number of issues as a result, including fewer revenues and less than ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotels' primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to offer thorough business advice to address this problem.

The analysis of hotel booking cancellations as well as other factors that have no bearing on their business and yearly revenue generation are the main topics of this report.
## Assumptions
1. No unusual occurrences between 2015 and 2017 will have a substantial impact on the data used.
2. The information is still current and can be used to analyze a hotel's possible plans inan efficient manner.
3. There are no unanticipated negatives to the hotel employing any advised technique.
4. The hotels are not currently using any of the suggested solutions.
5. The biggest factor affecting the effectiveness of earning income is booking cancellations.
6. Cancellations result in vacant rooms for the booked length of time.
7. Clients make hotel reservations the same year they make cancellations.
## Research Question
1. What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?
2. How can we make hotel reservations cancellations better?
3. How will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?
## Hypothesis
1. More cancellations occur when prices are higher.
2. When there is a longer waiting list, customers tend to cancel more frequently.
3. The majority of clients are coming from offline travel agents to make their reservations.
## Analysis and Findings

The accompanying bar graph shows the percentage of reservations that are canceled and those that are not. It is obvious that there are still a significant number of reservations that have not been canceled. There are still 37% of clients who canceled their reservation, which has a significant impact on the hotel's earnings.

In comparison to resort hotels, city hotels have more bookings. It's possible that resort hotels are most expensive than those in cities.

The line graph above shows that, on certain days, the average daily rate for a city hotel is less than that of a resort hotel, and on other days, it is even less. It goes without saying that weekends and holidays may see a rise in resort hotel rates.

We have developed the grouped bar graph to analze the months with the highest and lowest reservation levels according to reservation status. As can be seen, both the number of confirmed reservations and the number of canceled reservations are largest in the month of August. whereas January is the month with the most canceled reservations.
